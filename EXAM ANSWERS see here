a. Program to check divisibility by 2 and 11 without using functions:

python
Copy code
numbers = []

# Input the 5 numbers
for i in range(5):
    num = int(input("Enter number {}: ".format(i+1)))
    numbers.append(num)

divisible_by_2_and_11 = True

# Check divisibility for each number
for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 != 0 or num % 11 != 0:
        divisible_by_2_and_11 = False
        break

# Print the result
if divisible_by_2_and_11:
    print("All numbers are divisible by 2 and 11")
else:
    print("Not all numbers are divisible by 2 and 11")
b. Trace of the program:

Let's trace the program execution with an example:

Enter number 1: 22
Enter number 2: 33
Enter number 3: 44
Enter number 4: 55
Enter number 5: 66

The user is prompted to enter the first number.
The user inputs 22.
The program appends 22 to the numbers list.
The user is prompted to enter the second number.
The user inputs 33.
The program appends 33 to the numbers list.
Steps 4-6 are repeated for the remaining three numbers.
The variable divisible_by_2_and_11 is initialized as True.
The program starts checking divisibility for each number in the numbers list.
The first number, 22, is divisible by both 2 and 11, so no action is taken.
The second number, 33, is not divisible by 2. Since the number is not divisible by 2, the variable divisible_by_2_and_11 is set to False, and the loop breaks.
The program proceeds to prin
